I need help to translate locales for a factorio mod.

I'll give you some samples and each time you'll give me back the french translation.
Hints:

- beware of special keys `__ITEM__*__` `__CONTROL__*__` and `__ENTITY__*__`
- Coolant should be translated into "Liquide de refroidissement"

Sometimes you don't finish the generation, when I say "continue" you need to continue the job.

I don't want you to invent or imagine additional locale keys, I just want french translations.

Here is the sample:
